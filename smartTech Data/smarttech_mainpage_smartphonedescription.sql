Apple''s new flagships are more powerful than ever to compete in a very attractive competition, better than the Android flagships. Among the main changes planned for these smartphones compared to the flagships of the iPhone 12 family, we can point to more powerful camera sensors, a super processor with better performance and dazzling than the previous generation, high color variety, and a much better quality screen.

In this review, we went to the iPhone 13 Pro Max as the flagship of the family''s smartphones to see what features it has with it and what changes in the technical specifications are considered compared to the iPhone 12 Pro Max.', 4001);

The Galaxy S21 and S21+ now feature lower-res OLEDs, no microSD expansion, and no chargers in the box. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S21 Ultra is what the original Ultra should have been - jam-packed with high-end features, no asterisks, no fine print. Still no charger, though.

The original S20 Ultra was supposed to be the greatest Galaxy to date, but it fell short of that. You could enjoy a 120Hz refresh rate, but only at a lower 1080p resolution. The telephoto camera was advertised as 5x, but it was, in fact, 4x, and let''s not even start with the Space Zoom. The ultrawide camera had a great sensor, but it couldn''t do macro shots due to the lack of autofocus. The battery was large, but battery life was poor. You get the point.

Well, the Galaxy S21 Ultra makes up for everything. It has a large 1440p screen with native 120Hz support, adaptive at that. It also brings two dedicated telephoto snappers - one for 3x and another one for 10x optical zoom. Its ultrawide camera does feature autofocus, which works for macro shots. The new Ultra also offers ultrawide-band support, and surprise, surprise, S-Pen support as well. This has to be the first non-Note Galaxy phone to offer that - one for the history books.

There is no S-Pen socket on the Galaxy S21 Ultra, and neither is there a bundled stylus. But you can use any S-Pen that''s been in circulation, as well as the newly announced S-Pen for S21 Ultra and the upcoming S-Pen Pro. Samsung has also opened the S-Pen to third-party companies that make Wacom-based styluses, so you can expect even more options in the upcoming months. Finally, you can store the stylus in your pocket or opt for some S21 Ultra cases with dedicated pen holders.

The Galaxy S21 Ultra is the only S21 model to come with a 1440p OLED screen, unlike the previous generation. And even better, it now supports 120Hz at that high resolution, so you don''t need to choose between high res and high refresh rate. This new Ultra screen also supports Adaptive Refresh Rate that can vary between 10Hz and 120Hz, just like the Note20 Ultra.', 4002);

It definitely feels that way. Yet, here we are with the latest and greatest Z Fold3 - a third-generation product, or perhaps even fourth, depending on how you count the initial failed Fold launch back in the day. Foldables are maturing and already a staple, of sorts, within Samsung''s lineup. In fact, the Korean giant has now been consistently delivering Fold devices on a yearly schedule, and this year, it came at the expense of the new Galaxy Note lineup. Oh, how the tables have turned.

In fact, the Z Fold3 is arguably closer to a Note than ever. One of its major highlights being S Pen support. A first with a foldable display and quite the technical challenge to pull off. Speaking of firsts and technical challenges, the Z Fold3 is also the first foldable to sport an official ingress protection rating. Nothing too ambitious, just IPX8, but quite the engineering challenge to pull-off, as well.

The list of improvements on the Z Fold3 also includes an under-display selfie camera in place of the older punch-hole one. Another impressive engineering move, but one that has both its positives and negatives, which we will get into. The smaller external display is also slightly different this time around in terms of dimensions, but more importantly, it can now do 120Hz refreshing, just like the main folding panel.

There are, of course, other smaller differences between the older Z Fold2 and the Z Fold3 here and there, which we will do our best to highlight in the review. Things like a sturdier aluminum build on the new model. With all said and done, however, the Z Fold3 is not a monumental upgrade over its predecessor. It is very much an incremental one. Another fact that has its benefits and drawbacks.', 4003);

They took their "Awesome is for everyone" slogan to heart with interesting and fresh designs, as well as good value specs. Better still, the Korean giant definitely recognizes it has a good product on its hands and is now investing even further in extending its life. Particularly the Galaxy A52, which now has a new A52s 5G variant.

Technically, it can be considered another generation of the product, compared to the vanilla A52 and the A52 5G, though there aren''t too many new changes here. The first two A52 models came out back in March, with the 5G one swapping the original''s Snapdragon 720G for a 5G-capable Snapdragon 750G and the 90Hz, 6.5 Super AMOLED display for a 120Hz one. All the while keeping the two devices physically identical.

Now the Galaxy A52s 5G takes the Galaxy A52 5G and builds on top of it even further, swapping the chipset once again with an even better Snapdragon 778G 5G chipset, effectively addressing one of the few issues we had with the original - a slightly underpowered chipset.

And that''s about it - a significant leap forward in performance and a few other minor specs additions that the new chipset affords, like Wi-Fi 6 compatibility, but still the exact same phone. Arguably, with less changes than going from the vanilla A52 to the A52 5G.', 4004);

Samsung''s naming is a bit iffy in the lower tier and it can get confusing what''s what between the A and M series but the A12 sits just below the M12, and above the M02s. Not all of these models are available globally so you may or may not be able to snatch the most affordable Samsung in your particular neck of the woods.

The Galaxy A12 we have here is equipped with a 6.5-inch display and the consequences of the budget constraints are easy to spot. It''s one of few LCDs in the OLED-dominated Galaxy lineup, and the 720p resolution is also on the low side of average for the diagonal. It''s a fairly standard combo of size, technology and resolution for the segment, so the A12 isn''t ill-equipped, in fact.

The Mediatek Helio P35 is doing the math inside the A12 and that too isn''t a particularly exciting bit of hardware on its own. Again, however, it''s perfectly adequate for the price point - you''re getting an octa-core CPU and the chip is built on a 12nm fabrication process, so it should be decently powerful and frugal at the same time.

The quad camera setup on the back actually makes a strong case for the Galaxy A12 in its market context. While the usefulness of the two 2MP modules is debatable (one for depth data, the other for ''macro''), the 48MP main camera and a 5MP ultrawide make for nice tandem that''s hard to find. An 8MP selfie camera completes the picture in the imaging department.

One last important bit - the Galaxy A12 is powered by a 5,000mAh battery and that''s a lot of battery for a 12nm entry-level chipset and a 720p display, 6.5-inch as it may be. We''re expecting solid numbers for battery life.', 4005);

Anyway, the Redmi 9A is a good phone for its €99 price and it will do just fine for calls, emails, chats, social networks and web browsing. It''s a bit sluggish, but if you won''t be playing games, you''d be fine with it.', 4006);

These two mid-rangers reach new heights with 120Hz screens, flagship-grade chips, stereo speakers, large batteries. And today, we''ll be exploring the cheaper Poco X3 Pro - the first Snapdragon 860 carrier - and its bang for the buck features.

The Poco X3 Pro builds on top of the Poco X3 NFC, and they both look alike. The Pro version employs much better hardware, though - it is the first phone to run on the Snapdragon 860 SoC - a repackaged version of the once (and still) flagship Snapdragon 855+ chip.

Just like the Poco X3 NFC, the Poco X3 Pro is IP53-rated for dust protection and splash resistance, it packs a 6.67" IPS LCD screen with 1080p resolution and 120Hz refresh rate support, and the same 5,160mAh battery capable of 33W fast charging. You also get stereo speakers, a microSD slot, NFC, an IR blaster, and even a 3.5mm jack.

Oddly, the camera is a bit different and not in a good way. See, the Poco X3 Pro has a quad-camera on its back with a 48MP primary, an 8MP ultrawide, a 2MP macro, and a 2MP depth snappers. It''s not bad, it''s just that the regular X3 model offered a 64MP main and a 13MP ultra-wide shooters, and we can''t but feel the Pro as being demoted in this department.

Well, obviously the most significant upgrade since the original X3 is the much-improved SoC, which should allow for reaching beyond 60fps on many of the popular games and utilize the full potential of the 120Hz screen. This is often an issue with the HRR-capable mid-rangers, and we will gladly take the update, be it at the expense of some camera megapixels.', 4007);

We are not sure how Xiaomi can keep uninterrupted production of so many phones with the ongoing global chip shortages. But we are glad things are working well for them so far.

The Mi 11 Lite 5G has already earned our recommendation, and we are hoping its cheaper version to be just as good. The lightweight Mi 11 Lite, just like the Mi 11 Lite 5G, is shaped after the Mi 11 flagship and focuses on similar features - an HRR OLED screen, enjoyable camera quality, long battery life, fast charging, and overall smooth UI experience.

The Mi 11 Lite relies on the Snapdragon 732G chip - the same one we experienced as part of the Redmi Note 10 Pro. That''s the only notable difference with the Mi 11 Lite 5G - the 5G model uses a more powerful Snapdragon 780G 5G SoC.

The Mi 11 Lite may have undergone an obvious cost-cutting process, but it still gets to enjoy stereo speakers, NFC connectivity, a microSD slot, and even an IR port. And, by looking at its specs sheet, it does seem like a Lite version done right.

We are glad to see Xiaomi has thoughtfully handpicked the features that matter the most. The 6.55-inch OLED is of great quality with 10-bit color support, HDR10 certification, and a 90Hz refresh rate. There is also 240Hz touch sampling, which is another requirement for a smooth experience.

The triple camera on the back is also reminiscent of the Mi 11''s and the same as on the Mi 11 Lite 5G - there is a high-res 64MP primary, an 8MP ultrawide snapper, and a 5MP telemacro cam. All sorts of shooting modes are supported, including Night Mode, Long Exposure, Pro mode for all cameras, and the Mi 11 series exclusive video modes such as Parallel World, Time Freeze, Night Mode Timelapse, among others.', 4008);

It''s not ''lite,'' that''s for sure. This is the Galaxy S20 FE 5G (or Fan Edition). The latest member of the S20 family comes with some spec changes to meet a lower price point, while still maintaining important bits to qualify for the S-series badge.

One of those is the high-end chipset, and that''s a good point to clarify that not all FEs are the same - there is a 5G-capable version and an LTE-capped one. The 4G-only model follows the usual regional differentiation with some parts of the world getting the Exynos 990 while others have their FEs equipped with the Snapdragon 865.

On the other hand, the 5G model is Snapdragon-only this time, regardless of locale. It''s this version that we''re reviewing, though we may be dropping the ''5G'' when referring to the phone for the remainder of this review.

Placed in between the S20 and S20+ in terms of screen size, the Fan Edition packs a 6.5-inch Super AMOLED display. This one''s not HDR10+ compliant and has a FullHD resolution next to its QHD brethren, but Samsung did keep the 120Hz refresh rate.

As part of the tri-set of cameras on the FE, it gets to keep the S20s main big-sensor 12MP shooter. The ultra wide-angle cam takes 12MP shots too, but from a smaller imager than on the non-fan editions. And the telephoto is different too - fans will be shooting with an 8MP almost-3x zoom unit, as opposed to the slightly odd 64MP non-tele tele setup on the S20 and S20+. Meanwhile, the selfie camera on the FE is a 32MP Tetracell unit, which may sound like an upgrade compared to the 10MP modules of the S20 and S20+, but there''s more to that as you go deeper.

Perhaps that''s an appropriate spot to mention that the P smart 2021 also goes by the name Y7a in some markets, with identical specs.

We''ll go with ''P smart 2021'' for the remainder of this review because that''s what it says on our unit''s box, but our findings should be equally applicable to the Y7a.

It''s also worth noting that Honor has a very similarly specced 10X Lite that also looks a lot like the P smart 2021. We''ll be checking that one out too in the coming days.

Anyway, the P smart 2021 features a large 6.67-inch FullHD display, and it''s an LCD as opposed to OLED - OLEDs can be had in this price bracket, but not on this one.

The 2 extra nanometers shouldn''t be a huge burden, however, and with a 5,000mAh battery inside next year''s P smart, we expect solid endurance numbers.

The M52 5G is equipped with the Snapdragon 778G 5G SoC (same as the A52s 5G), so you''ll be getting great performance for the class, latest-gen connectivity, and potentially great battery life, an area where the 5,000mAh power pack certainly helps (4,500mAh on the A models). The M series can have 120Hz screens, too, and the M52 5G''s 6.7-inch AMOLED is also slightly larger than the 6.5-inch ones of the A trio - bigger is better, some say.

In the imaging department, Samsung has scrapped the 5MP depth camera, much to nobody''s objection. Fret not - the 5MP ''macro'' unit is still here. More importantly, there''s a 64MP primary camera and a 12MP ultrawide, as well as a 32MP one for selfies.

Some concessions had to be made to fit the budget, naturally.

The Face ID. Once a software gimmick, Apple has made it the next-step in biometric security. The company was so sure in its capabilities that it immediately retired the Touch ID. The Face ID sensor also made possible a new level of selfies and incredible accurate facial expression tracking with the Animojis. A little nudge capable of pushing the whole industry.
