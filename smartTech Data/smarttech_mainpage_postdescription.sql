Vivo has been around since 2009 when it launched in its native China, but only started expanding internationally in 2014.

Having found recent success by holding among the top positions in the Chinese smartphone market, as well as being the second-placed vendor in India and leading in Indonesia, Vivo looked to expand even further more recently.

The vendor only launched in both the UK and Europe a year ago – amid the pandemic, no less – and has released phones including the X60 Pro 5G, V21 5G and Y52 5G.

Vivo’s chief operating officer, Alex Wu, says the company has plans to make itself a household name across the UK, but can the vendor live up to expectations after major success across Asia?

Global brand
Speaking to Mobile News, Wu said that being a global brand means having a portfolio that can meet a variety of needs.

“Our current flagship phone is the X60 Pro 5G, which delivers a professional camera experience,” he says. “For the generation of online content creators, we have the V series – such as the V21 5G, with an outstanding 44MP front-facing camera.

“For those who want a future-proof phone that can keep up with their everyday life and not cost a small fortune, we have the impressive Y52 5G.”

Despite being a relatively new brand and only recently expanding to global markets, Vivo was the fourth-placed smartphone brand worldwide by shipments in the third quarter of 2021, according to Counterpoint Research – and hopes to keep growing.

‘Progressive’
“We at Vivo see ourselves as a progressive global brand that is committed to connecting users around the globe through a human- centric approach to the design of exciting and innovative smartphones that truly add value to the lives of our consumers,” says Wu.

This consumer-driven approach will be followed in the UK too, says Wu. Citing video content as becoming increasingly popular among the country’s consumers, he points to the X60 Pro 5G as a phone that has been launched with technology allowing users to capture super-steady video.

“By listening to consumers and understanding their needs, we plan to build a business model in the UK which answers the unmet needs of consumers,” says Wu. He adds that having a great camera is important to UK consumers, referring to how Vivo seeks to fulfil these needs too. “To deliver the best possible camera we can, we have established a strategic long-term collaboration with Zeiss, a pioneer in optics and optoelectronics,” says Wu. “It’s this combination of hardware and software expertise that allows us to deliver innovations such as the Gimbal 2.0 [stablisation technology] seen on the X60 Pro 5G.”', 1001);

Its establishment is the culmination of years of hard work and planning by founders Ben Wood and Matt Chatterley.

The museum, a charity that has been heavily supported by Vodafone through a five-year partnership, is now live online and currently features more than 2,000 phones from over 200 manufacturers – with the numbers set to grow.

Mobile News was fortunate to have a golden ticket to the event, which was held as an exhibition in Soho and attended by around 150 fortunate people, including myself.

Wood, who is also chief of research at CCS Insight, first thought up the idea for the museum way back in 2004, long before the modern-day smartphone was a thing and at a time when feature phones and mobile cameras were in the earlier stages of innovation.

He later joined forces with fellow mobile industry veteran and phone collector Chatterley, and after their vision gathered pace, the museum has become a reality for the pair.

We spoke to Wood to catch up after the event, and find out more about the origins of the museum and what the future holds for the initiative.

What are your thoughts on the event?
For me, the event was the culmination of years and years of work, and it was incredible to see a personal passion project come to fruition. What was lovely about the event was that not only was it a way to formally launch the Mobile Phone Museum and have the focal point to really drive publicity on the website – which we’ve been working on now for over two years – but also an opportunity to see many of the people that have been so supportive of the project and bring together so many people who have been involved in this amazing industry. Everything that happened on the evening was made possible by Vodafone’s amazing generosity.

Vodafone has really bought into the project and has made a multi-year investment in the charity, putting us on a firm financial footing to keep us going forward.

You seemed to be quite emotional during your speech?
Yeah, I was quite emotional [laughs]; I forgot to thank my wife during my speech, which was quite unforgivable! She’s also been very supportive and is running the educational side of things.

I’m still coming down to Earth after it all, and I’m really chuffed with how it went. It’s a shame it was for one night only.

What’s the purpose of the museum?
We want it to be a rich learning resource and a way to inspire young people to go on to create incredible mobile innovations of their own in the future.

At the launch, we had Soho Primary School come along too, because one of the pillars of the venture is that it’s a means to drive interest from the next generation of engineers and designers in what we’re doing.

We’re going to ramp up our visits into schools to try and deliver a positive view on mobile phones. They can often be seen as a distraction, but we can talk about their history and how the UK was the epicentre of phone development over the years.

Why are you trying to inspire the next generation? 
I hope it can educate people to realise that the UK has been so pivotal in this industry. We still have some big companies here – whether it’s Arm or Vodafone or BT – who are all massively important in this communications world.

We have individuals such as Jony Ive, one of the most famous designers of our time who has been involved in things including the iPhone.

Although I don’t think we’ll get back to the point that you’ll see a major mobile phone brand emerge from the UK, I certainly think you’ll see talent from engineering and design that could play an important role. The Mobile Phone Museum is very much a design story.

The only challenges are that phones have got a bit boring – or what I like to call the ‘sea of sameness’ since the iPhone – but I am optimistic that with the advent of foldables and flexible display technology, we may see a new wave of innovation and that could be quite exciting.', 1002);

This is according to Counterpoint Research, which estimates that Apple hit the landmark in April after launching the series last October, with the line-up comprising four 5G-ready models – the standard iPhone 12, as well as Mini, Pro and Pro Max versions.

By comparison, it took nine months for the same landmark to be achieved with the previous iPhone 11 series, released in September 2019.

But what has driven the series to be so successful, amid a crippling pandemic?

Spend redirected 
Peter Richardson, VP, partner and research director at Counterpoint, thinks the traction seen is down to pent-up spending.

“Consumers haven’t been going out because of the pandemic or spending money on foreign holidays, or at restaurants or pubs as they normally would,” he says.

“I also think that consumers, particularly in the socio-economic strata that typify Apple users, have saved up a lot of money over the last year and chosen to splash out on a brand new phone.”

Richardson adds that Apple users on iPhone 7s or 8s have seen the benefits of upgrading to the 12 series as device lifecycles lengthen.

“The lengthening replacement cycle has also played a part in this,” says Richardson. “We’re now seeing people spending more on their phones, with the premise that they’ll last for longer.

“A lot of iPhone 7 or 8 users, for example, might have upgraded to the iPhone 12 series, which represents a good upgrade and significant innovation changes.”

Richardson notes that the cameras on iPhone 12 devices have been a step in the right direction to take on the Android players, which he says have typically been ahead with such innovations.

Meanwhile, IDC research manager Marta Pinto says the timing of the launch has played into Apple’s hands.

“A contributing factor to the success is that the series was launched towards the end of 2020,” she says. “Everything launched at this price point much earlier in the year was hitting the market at a time when there was much uncertainty. People didn’t know if they would lose their jobs and everyone was unaware how the economy would react.”

But she says that upgrades were more on the cards by the end of the year, with people working from home and saving money from not going on holidays – as well as maybe feeling more job security.', 1003);

Over a year since the coronavirus pandemic first swept the globe, the impacts are still very much being felt and expected to last for a long time to come.

One of the biggest changes has been around the approach of businesses to the working environment, with widespread remote working enforced in March 2020 as the UK locked down.

But a year later, as employees start being able to return to offices, what approach will companies take to working in the future?

Mobile News asked those within the mobile channel for their take.

Data Select head of marketing Adam Sweeney 
We will continue a hybrid model of both an in-office presence and remote working, as this has proved effective during the pandemic.

Encouragingly, we have continued to grow our business and serve our customers well even while needing to pivot to a hybrid way of working. Trying to maintain a personal touch when working remotely is, of course, a challenge and you can never 100 per cent replicate the ‘in-person’ spirit of the office, the ‘water cooler’ chats and camaraderie.

Naturally, and in complete compliance with government guidelines, we will look to meet with both our customers and brand partners as and when they are ready to do so.

I am a big advocate of our hybrid approach to office and remote working, but the ability to go and meet my network of connections in person will bring the biggest smile.

As we continue our growth plans, we will naturally scale the business and ensure we add value to our brand partners asking for the most comprehensive reach into the mobile and IT channel. We will also, of course, maintain the high levels of channel engagement we have built our business around.

Remaining positive and motivated throughout this time, while providing leadership and guidance, has been key – and the way that each and every person in our business has risen to the challenge and continued to deliver a first class service is truly inspiring.', 1004);

Given the way in which 2020 threw the world for a loop, it would have been  entirely forgivable if no one wanted to give us any bold statements about what 2021 might have in store for telecoms.

With that in mind, it’s nothing short of admirable that Mobile News has received the breadth of submissions that it has from across the industry. In this article, you’ll find predictions from professionals across several sectors, with our round-up of telecoms analysts’s views coming later in the week.

Covid-19 has impacted handset sales, forced a reconsideration around the deployment of 5G networks, and accelerated remote working trends that many thought were half a decade from realisation.

Having spent almost a year in the much-maligned ‘new normal’, leaders from across the telecoms industry weigh in on what stands to change, and what will stay the same.

2020 and specifically the pandemic acted as a catalyst for accelerated growth and adoption of everything virtual with some trend observers suggesting the world has seen a quantum leap of five to seven years in online behaviour and technology adoption; this has been wide spread with the older generation becoming more engaged as a means of maintaining contact with loved ones; and being able to order online supplies and avoid leaving the home.

Four macro trends have arisen and these will continue to gather momentum in 2021.

Mobile connectivity – the need to be ‘always on’ has shifted from cities where network infrastructure is strong to rural areas where it is more challenged; consumers have reviewed what they have and made change to ensure that their signal and package matches their new normal; this has slowed 5G adoption in some areas and accelerated it in others. In cities it has bolstered home connectivity via hotspots whereas in the countryside there is no infrastructure to support it. As the world starts moving again in 2021, having the right mobile connectivity will continue to take centre stage.

Home connectivity has become vital driven by working from home, education and entertainment; reinforcing the need for high quality speed and seamless connectivity, and causing consumers to upgrade or switch provider. 2021 will see this continue with the new normal maintaining home working, and home entertainment growing with virtual events such as concerts and playsp.

It is anticipated that there will be more spectators of virtual games as a new sports trends surge online; the digital world has been opened up across all age groups and this trend will continue to grow in 2021.

Retail subscriptions have surged in 2020 with more consumers understanding the convenience of adopting these-eg pet food, beauty products, male grooming; and how they can be used for at home education and development via cooking, crafting etc. 67 per cent of homes had at least one subscription at the end of 2020 and this trend will quadruple by 2025.', 1005);

That changed dramatically last week, when the government ordered its equipment to be removed by 2027 and slapped a ban on future Huawei purchases by networks.

The move followed new advice by the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre after it reviewed US sanctions on Huawei.

Former head of MI6 Sir John Sawers had previously questioned the security of allowing any involvement by Huawei in UK 5G rollouts.

“The latest US sanctions, at the end of June, mean that reliable non-Chinese suppliers to Huawei can no longer work with the company.

“UK intelligence services can therefore no longer provide the needed assurances that Chinese-made equipment is still safe to use in the UK’s telecoms network,” he warned.

The ban on Huawei is set to cause huge problems for UK networks. Vodafone UK chief technology officer Scott Petty warned the government that the UK would fall behind in the 5G race if mobile operators were forced to spend time and money replacing existing equipment, potentially slowing the technology’s deployment by as much as two years.

Vodafone and BT also warned of signal blackouts if Huawei equipment was to be removed by 2027.

So what does the Huawei ban mean for the 5G picture in the UK?

Unfortunately, no mobile operator was prepared to offer us comment because of the issue’s sensitive nature. However, industry analysts we spoke to before the decision gave us insight into what a ban might mean.

(NB: questions were asked pre-ban)

INSERT INTO smarttech.mainpage_postdescription (id, description, post_id) VALUES (2007, 'Google’s approach to its Pixel devices has always been a bit puzzling. You can’t accuse it of not taking its phones seriously; it markets them fairly heavily, ensures that they have strong operator partnerships when they launch (at least in the few countries it does launch them), and you don’t buy a big chunk of HTC’s mobile division, as Google did, if you don’t intend to do something with it.

While the Pixels have repeatedly offered smooth software experiences (as to be expected from the very creator of Android), critics have often found fault with their hardware or design. Most recently, the Pixel 4 seemed like Google’s attempt to deliver the exact disappointment its fans were most concerned about.

At a launch price of £669, the device came with 64GB storage, a quick-to-drain 2,800mAh battery, an erratic new Motion Sense mode, facial unlock that worked when your eyes were closed, and a 90Hz display that initially didn’t run at 90Hz all the time. Even its screen to bezel ratio was slightly smaller than that of the Samsung Galaxy S8, a phone two years its senior. Google had also ditched unlimited full-quality image backup on Google Photos, which made the 64GB storage baseline feel even more insulting.

It’s evident from the changes Google has made to its Pixel launches this year that it has put some consideration into the types of devices it wants to make, but it’s still a slightly odd lineup.

Its Pixel 4a shares more DNA with the 5 than the 4, and the 4a 5G isn’t just a 5G version of the 4a, but more like a Pixel 5 Lite, as it shares the 5’s exact chipset and camera setup, as well as being the biggest device of the bunch, while being made from the same material as the 4.

All in all, it’s a device lineup that, while distinct, is much less clear-cut than the more defined ‘good, better, best’ approach that other vendors take, so I’m going to try to unpack it.

5 vs 4
This year, Google has repositioned its leading Pixel device. It’s still a premium device, for sure, but it costs £599, coming in at £70 cheaper than the 4 at launch, and there’s no XL version. Google has had to make some interesting changes here. It has to position the 5 as an improvement on the 4, but it can’t just make the phone both better and cheaper, so there are some trade-offs.

The biggest indicator of this is that the 5 is only packing a Snapdragon 765. This is a downgrade on the Pixel 4, and in terms of raw performance it’s well behind the likes of this year’s Samsung Galaxy S20, Huawei’s P40 Pro, and probably also the iPhone 12. However, it does come with 8GB RAM as opposed to the 4’s 6GB, and with 128GB storage as standard, making Google’s ongoing decision to deny its users unlimited original quality image storage a bit more forgivable.

Furthermore, Motion Sense is conspicuous in its absence. Getting rid of a built-in radar that didn’t have any practical applications has probably made Google’s decision to drive down pricing on the Pixel 5 much easier. It’s probably hoping to regain some lost critical goodwill on this device before driving a much more focused Motion Sense experience on the Pixel 6 next year.

On the design front, the Pixel 5 is missing that glass back that was really very appealing on the 4, instead featuring a metal back with a matte finish that makes it feel like plastic. It feels a bit cheap, but A) that isn’t the same as actually being cheap and B) it is grippy and very fingerprint resistant, especially in the Sorta Sage colour.

The 5 is more compact than the 4, but Google has ditched the bezels in favour of a punch-hole camera, so you’re getting a 6-inch Gorilla Glass 6 screen instead of a 5.7-inch screen. There’s still no option for a permanent 90Hz refresh rate, with the same “smooth display” setting that “raises the refresh rate for some content”, but it seems to be on all the time.

Despite the Pixel 5’s smaller size, Google has managed to fit in a 4,080mAh battery, which, due to the weaker processor, actually lasts a good amount of time. This battery confidently blows past anything Google has put in its phones before, and given the removal of Motion Sense and facial unlock sensors, hints at just how much they were holding back the previous Pixel iteration from getting the basics right.

The Pixel 5’s camera drops the telephoto lens seen in the 4 and the zoom does suffer as a result, but Google has added a 16MP ultrawide lens, and it can shoot 4K video at 60fps with features such as cinematic pan that can truly capitalise on its inclusion.

Losing the bezels also means losing the tech housed within those bezels, which was mainly front camera tech that enabled facial unlock. The 5 swaps that out for a fingerprint sensor on the back instead, and I don’t think people will mind, as the fingerprint sensor is very responsive and you’re getting more screen.

The comparison between the Pixel 4 and the Pixel 5 is interesting because it’s a rare case of a manufacturer removing features to make a device more attractive. Getting rid of facial unlock and Motion Sense has allowed Google to give the Pixel 5 more battery and storage, and make things like the lack of a telephoto lens and a permanent 90Hz display more forgiving at a cheaper price. Meanwhile, adding things like a telephoto lens and more screen estate only makes the phone more attractive.

In hardware terms, the Pixel 5 is blown out of the water by the OnePlus 8T and Samsung Galaxy S20 FE, which offer glitzier camera setups and superior chipsets at similar prices (the OnePlus 8T is even launching with Android 11). But compared to last year, it’s far more competitive, and of course adds a 5G capability while still keeping its price down – although manufacturers are already finding this easier to do.

5 vs 4a vs 4a 5G
Perhaps the pandemic forced Google to adapt its release strategy, with the Pixel 4a coming 15 months after the Pixel 3a, and the Pixel 4a 5G actually coming after the Pixel 5.

It makes the naming of the devices look strange, because when placed side by side, they look like a device family. There’s almost nothing to separate them at a glance, aside from size, the presence of a headphone jack on both 4a variants, and the 5’s metal body compared to the 4a’s polycarbonate housing.

Design
The regular 4a is comfortably the weakest of the three new devices, with a 3,140mAh battery, a Snapdragon 730G processor, and a camera missing an ultrawide lens, cinematic pan, and 4K video at 60fps. You can look at it in three different ways: as a sequel to the Pixel 3a; a cheaper cousin to the 4, with which it shares a number; or as a Lite version of the Pixel 5, which it preceded by less than two months and with which it shares an exterior design philosophy. Regardless, it’s still a great device for the price.', 1007);

Dixons Carphone’s decision to close its 531 standalone Carphone Warehouse stores as part of a major restructuring of its business has been described as “inevitable” by industry experts. 

The retailer will shut the stores on April 3, but will continue to offer mobile devices and SIMs through its Carphone shops-within-shops in its 305 nationwide Currys PC World stores.

Dixons Carphone said it expected around 40 per cent (1,800) of the affected employees will take new roles within the organisation, but added that the changes would lead to around 2,900 redundancies. 

Standalone Carphone Warehouse stores represent eight per cent of Dixons Carphone’s UK selling space.

Uswitch head of commercial for broadband and mobiles Ernest Doku said: “The shifting nature of the mobile market – combined with the ongoing pressures of the high street and recent performance – made this announcement from Carphone Warehouse feel somewhat inevitable. 

“Consumers have begun to take more time between upgrades as phones last longer, while perceived differences between models have become narrower to end users.” 

In addition, he says people feel less of an urge than before to physically see the latest phone before deciding to upgrade, relying more on content from price comparison sites and online influencers to deliver information on feel, form factor and features. 

“This has created a perfect storm in which Carphone has had to drastically change tack in order to ride it out,” said Doku. 

Consolidation
Speaking to Sky News, John Caudwell, founder of defunct retailer Phones4U, called the decision “inevitable” due to the consolidation of the mobile phone industry. 

Dixons Carphone group chief executive Alex Baldock hopes the move will bring Dixons Carphone back to profitability, although he expects a £90 million loss this year. 

He said: “Customers are changing how they buy technology, and Dixons Carphone must change with them. We’re under way with a fundamental transformation to do so.

“Today’s tough decision is an essential part of that – the next step in making our UK mobile business a success for customers, colleagues and other shareholders. 

“Clearly, with unsustainable losses of £90m expected this year, mobile is currently holding back the whole business. There’s never an easy time for an announcement like this, but the turbulent times ahead only underline the importance of acting now.” 

Employee support 
Baldock added that Dixons would attempt to provide financial support for employees who are made redundant. 

“I don’t underestimate how upsetting this news will be for our colleagues, and we’ll treat everyone with honesty, respect and care. 

“We’re working hard to look after those colleagues we can’t find new roles for, financially and otherwise. We’ll pay enhanced redundancy and any bonuses, honour their share awards, and help them find new jobs through an outplacement programme. We recognise our responsibilities towards our colleagues and communities, and intend to fulfil them. 

“But though this is by far the toughest decision we’ve had to make, it is necessary. We must follow our customers. They want help with all technology, all in one place, and this trend is only going to accelerate in a more connected 5G world.” 

In its financial results for the half year ending on October 26, 2019, Dixons Carphone reported an 18 per cent decline in mobile revenues in the UK and Ireland combined, while overall group profits fell from £60 million to £24 million. 

The retailer said the closures were unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic, and instead down to the changing mobile market. 

However, IDC associate vice president for devices Francisco Jeronimo believes the virus forced the retailer to announce its decision earlier than expected. 

“They have been posting losses for the past few quarters. The stress of having to close all stores for a period of time would have a major revenue impact, so I think they are moving straight away to this decision rather than waiting another quarter or two,” he said. 

Comparemymobile.com mobile expert Rob Baillie agreed, adding: “Whilst plans have likely been in place for Carphone Warehouse to close standalone stores for quite some time and it hasn’t directly blamed the coronavirus outbreak, the pandemic will certainly have exacerbated the situation.” 

CCS Insight director of consumer and connectivity Kester Mann said cutting back on physical retail space in favour of an online focus was a “logical move”. 

“Carphone Warehouse has been caught in the unfortunate cross hairs of lengthening mobile phone replacement cycles and ongoing apathy on the UK high street,” he said. “It has been clear for some time that something had to give in its business. 

“As well as saving costs, the company has an opportunity to offer a best-in- class web-based retail experience that could differentiate it from rivals.” 

Mann added: “With more than twice as many people expected to keep their current mobile phone for longer than their last one, footfall has declined and mobile phone retailing is tougher than ever. Carphone Warehouse had no option but to make some major changes.', 1008);

Most of Europe and the rest of the world use 3.2-3.8GHz. But the US 5G bandwidth goes up to 4.1-4.2GHz.

US airlines have written urgently to the US Secretary of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration and Federal Communications Commission to say commercial aviation in the US “is facing major disruption of the travelling and shipping public based on our evaluation of data and discussion to resolve the issue of how best to deploy 5G C Band from radio towers a safe distance around US airports.

Airplane manufacturers have informed us that there are huge swathes of the operating fleet that may need to be indefinitely grounded. In addition to the chaos caused domestically.

As part of the deal, the operator has also signed up Tim Henman and Laura Robson as brand ambassadors and also in talks with 2021 US Open winner Emma Radacanu.

From this summer, Vodafone will provide its 5G service at the event, while also showcasing its latest in AR, VR, haptic and IoT technology.

Vodafone is also working with AELTC and the LTA to develop a new grassroots competition.

Commenting on the partnership Vodafone consumer director Max Taylor said: “There is a huge buzz around British tennis and Wimbledon is set once again to be a high point of the summer. We want to build on this momentum long-term by helping people get involved in the sport.

AELTC commercial director Gus Henderson added: “We are looking forward to seeing how Vodafone will create unique experiences to bring our fans even closer to the action at Wimbledon this summer.”

The mega-site will span over 400 hectares and will initially house two chip factories with plans to expand up to eight fabs in the future. The complex will also support operations and other Intel partner ecosystems.

The new site will bring an initially estimated 3,000 Intel jobs and tens of thousands more construction jobs and long-term opportunities for the local economy. Intel is also devoting an additional $100 million to partner with local Ohio educational institutions to help mentor and develop local talent and bolster research programs throughout the Midwest region.

It will also bring a beefy 5,500 mAh battery with 68W charging though it remains to be seen if Lenovo is bringing back the dual USB-C ports of its predecessor which allowed for up to 90W charging speeds.

Legion Y90 will come with up to 18GB RAM and 512GB storage. It will feature dual X-axis vibration motors and symmetrical rear design similar to the Legion 2 series. Last year Lenovo had a Pro version so we’re expecting to see if there will be a Y90 Pro model this time around.', 1014);

The entire Tab S8 lineup was briefly listed on Amazon Italy and everything about them was made public. Frankly, it’s not much we didn’t already know about.

All three tablets will come with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset, Android 12 pre-installed, and the display sizes range from 11 inches, 12.4 inches on the Tab S8+, and 14.6 inches on the Ultra, as well as a dual-selfie camera setup that’s specific to the Ultra.

Battery capacities for all three tablets are 8,000, 10,090, and 11,200 mAh, respectively. Colors for the Tab S8 and Tab S8+ include silver, rose gold, and gray and there are Wi-Fi and 5G models for all three sizes. The Ultra will only come in gray.

All three models will include the S Pen and each will be able to place it on the back of the tablet just beneath the camera. In this case, all tablets each have a 13MP main camera. Here are the spec sheets for all three models.

The listings have already been taken down, but the timing could mean Samsung may be ready to release the tablets to European markets soon. We wonder whether the Galaxy S22 series will beat the Tab S8 series to launch or whether Samsung may launch them at the same time.', 1015);

Realme advised participants to back up data before proceeding and said they should have 10 GB free storage for the incoming package, otherwise, there might be installation failure, leading to boot loops.

The new software is labeled C.44 in all global markets.

This brings with it the January 2022 security patch level, which is welcome since we''re still in January. It''s also probably the update with the longest changelog we''ve ever seen from OnePlus. We won''t list everything here, but trust us - there are a ton of bug fixes and improvements promised. If you want to see the entire thing in all its glory, make sure you hit the Source link below.

In the post announcing the rollout, OnePlus says "this new release resolves a few of the pending issues", which means not all of them, but it''s still definitely a step in the right direction. The company also notes that some of the items in the changelog only apply to models in the EU region, but fails to mention exactly which.

Anyway, you can expect improvements to battery life, a smoother fingerprint unlocking process, a better charging animation, less scrolling lag in the Notification area, the addition of three adjustable levels for Dark mode, and a lot of stuff added and fixed in Shelf. The Work Life Balance feature is now available to all users, with automatic mode switching and customized app notification profiles. You also get improvements to the camera, 5G connectivity, the Canvas AOD feature, and the Gallery app.

As always, the over-the-air rollout of the update will be incremental, reaching a small percentage of devices today, with a broader rollout planned in a few days if nothing goes horribly wrong.', 1017);

Still, most analysts believe that we can expect updated vanilla iPad and iPad Air, as well as new Pro models in 2022. You can read more predictions about the basic iPad and the Air here while we focus on the new iPad Pro design.

The question of wireless charging has been a topic for discussion basically since Apple unveiled its MagSafe wireless charging tech for the iPhone. As per the latest chatter from industry insiders, Apple is already experimenting with at least one 2022 iPad Pro prototype with MagSafe on board.

Well, a variation of it, that is. Sources claim that Cupertino was particularly hesitant about swapping out the iPad''s traditional metal back for a glass one in order to facilitate wireless charging. Instead, the proposed solution is a large glass Apple logo, akin to that on the latest MacBook models. The prototype allegedly also has beefier magnets to prevent accidental detachment.

We have to wonder whether Apple is actually planning or if it''s even possible to use the MagSafe magnet mounting system in a more general fashion as a way to attach accessories like keyboards and stands to the iPad in a seamless and clean way. That would be quite interesting to see, particularly for keyboards since some users have been complaining of excessive battery drain from an attached Magic Keyboard. Perhaps newer models will be designed to charge the tablet is some way, as a dock of sorts, rather than leech off its battery.

Speaking of battery, most sources agree that the next iPad Pro will likely have a larger pack on board. Also on the potential list of new additions - a camera module similar to that on the iPhone 13, potentially new and brighter double-stacked OLED panels. Perhaps even ones with a notch to unify the aesthetic with the MacBook line? Though, that last one thankfully hasn''t popped up in the rumor mill nearly as often. We might even see the debut of an Apple M2 chip. After all Apple experienced a nice uptick in iPad sales in Q4 so it might just make sense to refine them even more aggressively. At least the Pro models, that is, the new Mini seems to be stepping on the toes of the iPhone 13 and its sales, so we don''t expect major movement there.', 1018);

The third model, the Find X5 Lite, appears to be an international release of the Reno7, so it there shouldn’t be any surprises in its spec sheet.

Back to the two more premium X5 models. It seems that both will support 80W fast charging with PPS-enabled power bricks (5-11V, 7.3A max). The rumor of 125W charging is proving to be false. Anyway, the Oppo Find X5 Pro is expected to have a 5,000 mAh battery, the vanilla model will likely use the same power pack. For comparison, the Find X3 and X3 Pro both had 4,500 mAh batteries with 65W charging.

Batteries aside, an X5 Pro unit was photographed with a Hasselblad camera and a “Powered by MariSilicon” label. This is an NPU developed by Oppo itself that will be fabbed on a 6 nm process. It will support 20-bit RAW image processing and will deliver up to 18 TOPS (int8).

For a better look at the Oppo Find X5 and X5 Pro design, check out these renders by the always accurate @OnLeaks.

There’s a lengthy list of fixes on the Google’s support page for the update. Major fixes include the use of Call Screen and bug squashes related to making emergency calls. There was also an issue related to battery drain under some conditions. There are also general UI fixes that should smoothen out the user-experience and Wi-Fi should be more stable.

It was meant to address bugs from the software builds that came before it, but it ended up causing signal issues to users globally. It even caused Google to disable a couple of its Pixel-exclusive features due to bugs and the while some users were updated to December, others were left on November’s update until Google could solve everything with a delayed December update – which never came for those stuck on the November update.
